# PyCitySchools Analysis

This challenge is an analysis of standardized test results from a city's school district. The goal was to aggregate and visualize data to help make informed strategic decisions about school budgets and priorities.

## Background

As the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I was tasked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results, including math and reading scores, and various information on the schools. The insights derived from this data will assist the school board and mayor in making data-driven decisions.

## Challenge Description

The challenge involves performing an in-depth analysis of the district's standardized test data and deriving key metrics to help identify trends in school performance. Specifically, the analysis includes:

1. **District Summary**: A high-level snapshot of key metrics such as the total number of schools, total students, average scores, and overall passing percentages.
2. **School Summary**: A breakdown of performance metrics for each individual school, including math and reading scores, passing percentages, and school budget.
3. **Top and Bottom Schools**: Identifying the highest and lowest performing schools based on overall passing percentages.
4. **Scores by Grade**: Breaking down the average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) at each school.
5. **Scores by School Spending**: Analyzing school performance based on the amount spent per student.
6. **Scores by School Size**: Analyzing performance based on school size (small, medium, and large).
7. **Scores by School Type**: Analyzing performance by the type of school (charter vs district).


## Data Analysis 

1. **District Summary**:
   - The district-wide summary contains metrics such as the total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the overall passing percentages in math, reading, and both.

2. **School Summary**:
   - This section provides a breakdown of individual school metrics like the number of students, the school's budget, the average math and reading scores, and the passing percentages for math, reading, and overall.

3. **Highest and Lowest Performing Schools**:
   - The top 5 and bottom 5 schools were identified based on overall passing percentages.

4. **Scores by Grade**:
   - A breakdown of average math and reading scores by grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

5. **Scores by School Spending**:
   - School performance was analyzed by categorizing spending per student into four bins: 
     - <$585
     - $585-$630
     - $630-$645
     - $645-$680
   - The average math scores, reading scores, and passing percentages were calculated for each spending range.

6. **Scores by School Size**:
   - Schools were categorized by size into three bins: 
     - Small (<1000 students)
     - Medium (1000-2000 students)
     - Large (2000-5000 students)
   - The average scores and passing percentages were calculated for each size category.

7. **Scores by School Type**:
   - Performance was broken down by school type (charter vs. district) to analyze any trends.
